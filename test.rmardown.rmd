mon premier paragraphe et mon premier chunk

This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
# rmarkdown::render("test.markdown.rmd",output_file="test")
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
```
